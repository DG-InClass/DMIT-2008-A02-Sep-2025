## Inside this Repository

This repository is Dan Gilleland's **Instructor Workbook** of the in-class demos and assorted homework solutions; see the [*`src/`*](./src/ReadMe.md) folder. I have some additional notes in the [**docs/mynotes**](./docs/mynotes/ReadMe.md) folder to record your notes from each class.

The course's [Brightspace site](https://lms.nait.ca/d2l/home) contains official information. Since this course builds on CPSC-1520, consider reviewing JavaScript fundamentals on Dan Gilleland's *ad-hoc* site: [**dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/**](https://dgilleland.github.io/CPSC-1520/).

Additionally, you can find online notes at the course's [Brightspace site](https://lms.nait.ca) and on the unofficial [slideshow notes](https://DMIT-2008.github.io/dmit2008/classes).

### Using This Workbook

As a **3 Credit** course, it should take approximately **135 hours** to complete. The scheduled in-class time is 4 hrs/week, which means only 60 hours are in-class and the remaining 75 hours are self-directed. Expect to do about 5 hrs/week of work *outside* of class!

More information about this workbook can be found in the [`~/docs/about/ReadMe.md`](./docs/about/ReadMe.md) file.
