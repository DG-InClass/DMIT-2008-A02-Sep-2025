# Playing Cards Addendum

What if we wanted the ability to *sort* our playing cards? How would we go about that?

The answer, in short, is to use the [`.sort()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method on our array of cards for each player.

The long answer is: We're going to have to modify the HTML generated by our JavaScript and slap on a few [`data-*` attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/How_to/Use_data_attributes) along the way.

> You can work on the version of Playing Cards from the [previous starter kit](../../011/PlayingCards/ReadMe.md), or you can copy the code from that folder and put it here as a [separate, expanded edition](./).
