# Weather Forecast Application

The weather app is a sample application that will be used as an example for exploring best practices and new topics in JavaScript, specifically ES6. The app will serve as a solid foundation for completing the first two major assignments in the course.

You are tasked with creating a simple web-based application that will allow for the
following:

- Enter a location for weather information
- View the current climate information for the location
  - Location, date, current conditions, temperature, sunrise, and sunset
- View the 5-day forecast for the location
  - Day, date, high, and low

This application will make use of the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/appid) , which is an open API
that can be used to retrieve various climate details for any location in the world.

You will build, alongside your instructor, all parts of this exercise (i.e. HTML and JS).
At a minimum, the application must include or demonstrate the following:

- A form for allowing the user to enter a location for weather search
- Proper scoping of all code used
- Properly documented code using an acceptable commenting convention (e.g.
[JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/))
- Adherence to a widely accepted code convention for code style
- A clear and coherent directory structure
- **Any other requirements as laid out by your instructor in class**

The emphasis in this assignment is on functionality, which essentially means that the aesthetics are of lesser (if any) concern. The exercise is geared towards getting the application to work correctly and demonstrating best practices and advanced understanding of JavaScript in the process.
